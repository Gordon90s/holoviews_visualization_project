    \subsection{1. The Role of Mathematical Visualization
}\label{the-role-of-mathematical-visualization}

Mathematics is for many an abstract language. It is not uncommon to find
textbooks that are solely comprised of text and dense formulas. Often
forgotten is that the mathematical language can in most cases be
translated into or supported by visualizations in a variety of intuitive
ways with multiple benefits. Visualizations undoubtably make the reading
experience more enjoyable and can significantly help and accelerate
understanding, increase curiosity and spark creativity. Approaching a
mathematical problem visually can also improve the research process by
encouraging a change of perspective. However, visualizations are
difficult to erase from one's memory, so if poorely constructed, they
can lead to confusion or if oversimplified, they can inhibit deeper
understanding.

Thus, a valuable visualization requires effort. Thanks to the ubiquity
of computers and rich open-source libraries, it has never been easier to
create beautiful looking and interactive visualizations. As a result,
adoption in recent years has increased in popularity as can for example
be attested by the success of the Youtube channel
\href{https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw}{3Blue1Brown}.
Its author, Grant Sanderson, is able to break down and explain visually
complex mathematical concepts in brief videos that have attracted a wide
ranging audience. A further marvellous creation is the currently under
completion online textbook
\href{https://jermwatt.github.io/mlrefined/index.html}{"Machine Learning
Refined"} written by Jeremy Watt and Reza Borhani. It is richly
populated with interactive graphics and animations illustrating the
current state of the art machine learning methods.

This project seeks to inspire the reader to consider the usefulness of
mathematical visualizations and explore their possible applications. For
this, we make use of the programming language Python for which we
present currently existing libraries in Section \ref{vizlandscape}.
Selecting one of the libraries, we use it to visualize concepts from
introductory numeric courses. We focus on selected algorithms in
Section \ref{algo_viz} and explore matrix visualization in
Section \ref{matrix_viz}.

We finish this section by showing our favorite visual proof of the
Pythagoras Theorem. Note the interactive widget on the right which lets
one vary the variable \(a\) between \(20\) and \(80\) (with
\(a+b:=100\)).

    \subsection{2. Python Visualization Landscape
}\label{python-visualization-landscape}

In this section, we explore the visualization libraries available in
Python. Here, one is easily overwelmed by the sea of possibilities as
can be witnessed in the following map:

    

    It was presented at the Python conference Pycon 2017 (with a recorded
presentation available on
\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPl9bMg8j8U}{Youtube}). As of
today, there is no tool serves all visualization purposes. Each tool has
its advantages and disadvantages and a compromise has to be made
depending on ones visualization goal. We briefly discuss some of the
available options.

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{\linethickness}\end{center}

\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{\emph{Matplotlib}}{Matplotlib}}\label{matplotlib}

Matplotlib is one of the oldest visualization tools in Python and was
inteded to ressemble and possibly substitute Matlab's visualization
tool. Over the years, several options of tools have been built on top
for specialized visualization application, for example
\textbf{\emph{Seaborn}} for statistical visualizations and
\textbf{\emph{NetworkX}} for network visualizations. While highly robust
and versatile, Matplotlib is also quite verbose. Most of the tools that
have spawned since are to alleviate some of its deficiencies.

\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{\emph{JavaScript}}{JavaScript}}\label{javascript}

Since widely used on the Internet, JavaScript is optimized for browser
use and can be leveraged for rendering graphics for online publication,
making it particularly attractive for Jupyter Notebook applications.
Here, the libraries \textbf{\emph{PythreeJS}} and
\textbf{\emph{IPyVolume}} allow for efficient 3D rendering and
\textbf{\emph{IPyleaflet}} enables the import of maps into the Notebook.
The libraries \textbf{\emph{Bokeh}}, \textbf{\emph{Plotly}} and
\textbf{\emph{bqplot}} all offer high quality interactive data
visualization tools. Plotly is similar to Bokeh with additionally good
3D plotting capabilities, but requires paid plans for some features. The
library \textbf{\emph{Cufflinks}}, built on top of Plotly, optimizes
interactive \textbf{\emph{Pandas}} charting and is often used for
analysing financial data, as is bqplot (the latter library being
developed by the financial media company Bloomberg).

\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{\emph{Datashader} and
\emph{Vaex}}{Datashader and Vaex}}\label{datashader-and-vaex}

Datashader and Vaex enable efficient interactive visualization of large
data sets.

\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{\emph{Vega} and
\emph{Altair}}{Vega and Altair}}\label{vega-and-altair}

Vega is a visualization grammar. Rather than forcing the user to specify
\emph{how} a visualization should be constructed, its intend is to let
the user focus on \emph{what} should be done. Data and relationships are
put in the foreground and leave out tinkering with incidental details -
at least in the first steps of data exploration. Altair is built on top
of Vega and enables visualizations with minimal amount of code in an
intuitive way. Additionally, instead of saving visualizations in the
form of pixels, the data is kept in the background, thus also easily
enabling interaction with the data and fascilitate formatting.

\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{\emph{HoloViews}}{HoloViews}}\label{holoviews}

Similar to Altair, HoloViews enalables interaction with the data on a
higher level. Once a type of plot is specified for a particular data
set, HoloViews intelligently visualizes the data with no further user
input required. Additionally, interactive visualizations are also easily
made possible with just a few lines of code. HoloViews can use Bokeh,
Plotly and Matplotlib as back-end.

\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{\emph{ggpy}}{ggpy}}\label{ggpy}

The tool ggpy seeks to also offer a higher lever of user interaction for
statistical visualization.

\paragraph{\texorpdfstring{\emph{OpenGL} and
\emph{Vispy}}{OpenGL and Vispy}}\label{opengl-and-vispy}

OpenGL is a cross-platform application programming interface (API) for
rendering 2D and 3D vector graphics which Vispy takes advantage of.
OpenGL is typically graphics processing unit (GPU) accelerated,
enabeling to visualize graphic intensive applications. It is for example
often used for computer-aided design (CAD), virtual reality and video
games.

\paragraph{Other Visualization Tools}\label{other-visualization-tools}

The tools in the lower left part in the above map have not been further
categorized. They represent to some extend competing libraries to those
described above and often differ in specific characteristics like speed
or cross-platform compatbility. \textbf{\emph{Mayavi}} is for example
similar to Vispy and enables good 3D visualization capabilities. Some
tools are being developed in collagoration with others like
\textbf{\emph{PyQtGraph}} and Vispy. Note that the links between
libraries are not limited to the ones visualized on the map, they often
inter-connect in myrads of ways.

    As with all ecosystems, the visualization landscape constantly evolves.
Some libraries will merge features and some will stop being developed.
The heatmap and function plot below show the GitHub commit activity of
all the libraries presented in the previous map (except OpenGL,
JavaScript, pandas and graphviz) over the past 52 weeks (the data was
gathered in August 2018). The rows correspond to the individual
libraries and have been sorted by their corresponding total number of
commits over the past year. The columns represent the weeks and the
colors show the amount of commits per week per library (yellow for a
high number, black for no commit). The function plot underneath the
heatmap charts the weekly commits for a specific library. This library
can be changed by clicking in the heatmap on a row corresponding to a
library of choice. 

    \begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
{\color{incolor}In [{\color{incolor}1}]:} \PY{k+kn}{from} \PY{n+nn}{py\PYZus{}code}\PY{n+nn}{.}\PY{n+nn}{repo\PYZus{}activity} \PY{k}{import} \PY{n}{repo\PYZus{}activity\PYZus{}viz}  \PY{c+c1}{\PYZsh{} import code for creating visualization}
        \PY{n}{repo\PYZus{}activity\PYZus{}viz}
\end{Verbatim}


    
    
    
    
    
    
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
{\color{outcolor}Out[{\color{outcolor}1}]:} :Layout
           .HeatMap.Repository\_Activity :HeatMap   [week,library]   (commits)
           .DynamicMap.I                :DynamicMap   []
              :Curve   [week]   (commits)
\end{Verbatim}
            
    From the above plot we observe that libraries such as ggpy and
\textbf{\emph{d3py}} are no longer actively developed while Matplotlib
remains undisputable the library with the most commits. (Note that we
left out \textbf{\emph{pandas}} from the above visualization, as the
library focuses mainly on non-visulization tools. Thus its high number
of commits would skew the skew our visualization.)

    \section{3. Introduction to HoloViews }\label{introduction-to-holoviews}

As described in the previous section, thanks to a high level synthax,
HoloViews enables to explore data and manipulate objects in a relatively
intuitive way with few lines of code. Additionally, it is actively being
developed to meet the many needs of data scientists and developer for
use in both the Jupyter Notebook and oustide. Furthermore, it is tightly
integrated and co-developed with other libraries to also enable working
with large data sets. The \href{http://pyviz.org/background.html}{PyViz
Project} illustrates the possible workflows within the HoloViews
surrounding ecosystem as following:

    For the remainder of this project, we use the HoloViews library and use
Bokeh as its back-end within the Jupyter Notebook. To familiarize
oneself with the library, we recommend the section
\href{https://gitlab.gwdg.de/jschulz1/math_prog/blob/master/lecture/22_holoviews.ipynb}{Mathematisch
orientiertes Programmieren - Holoviews} from Jochen Schulz's lecture (in
German). An
\href{http://holoviews.org/getting_started/index.html}{introduction} is
also provided on the \href{http://holoviews.org/}{HoloViews website},
with many more resources, in particular beautiful galleries
\href{http://holoviews.org/gallery/index.html}{here} and
\href{http://holoviews.org/reference/index.html}{here} (or Bokeh's
gallery
\href{https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/gallery.html}{here}).
Lastly, we highly recommend any reader seriously considering HoloViews
to go through the comprehensive
\href{http://pyviz.org/tutorial/index.html}{PyViz Tutorial} to learn
more about the finer controls of the tool, as in particular the plot
styling can lead to difficulties in the beginning. Held by one of the
core developers, this tutorial is also available in
\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=33\&v=aZ1G_Q7ovmc}{video
format}.

    From here on, we assume the reader to be accustomed to the HoloViews
synthax on a basic level. We adopt the standard import abbreviations for
HoloViews and Numpy as follows

    \begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
{\color{incolor}In [{\color{incolor}23}]:} \PY{k+kn}{import} \PY{n+nn}{holoviews} \PY{k}{as} \PY{n+nn}{hv}
         \PY{n}{hv}\PY{o}{.}\PY{n}{extension}\PY{p}{(}\PY{l+s+s1}{\PYZsq{}}\PY{l+s+s1}{bokeh}\PY{l+s+s1}{\PYZsq{}}\PY{p}{)}  \PY{c+c1}{\PYZsh{} HoloViews\PYZsq{} back\PYZhy{}end}
         \PY{k+kn}{import} \PY{n+nn}{numpy} \PY{k}{as} \PY{n+nn}{np}
\end{Verbatim}


    
    
    
    
    
    
    For our first example, we display in detail the used options. Following
on, to keep the displayed code as relevant as possible, we hide
technical parts in Python files (saved in the folder "py\_code") and
import them as seen previously. For example as follows

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ImportTok{from}\NormalTok{ py_code.example }\ImportTok{import}\NormalTok{ example}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

    \section{4. Algorithm Visualization }\label{algorithm-visualization}

In this section, we explore visualizations of some algorithms commonly
taught in introduction courses to numerical analysis.

\subsection{4.1. Newton's Method}\label{newtons-method}

Newton's method is a method for finding successively better
approximations to the roots of a real-valued function, say \(f\). I.e.
the method seeks to find \(x\) such that \(f(x) = 0\) or close to. Here,
we assume \(f:[a,b] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\) to be a differentiable
function defined on the interval \([a,b]\).

We begin by defining a function \(f\) (with real root) we wish to
visualize and plot it below. We choose
\(f(x)= \frac{1}{10}x^2 - x + 1\).

    \begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]

\end{Verbatim}
            
    This output is based on the default plotting parameters. Improving the
visual appeal of this plot unfortunately becomes more tedious, but could
be done in the following way:

    In the above plot we actived the hover-tool. By dragging the cursor over
the function, we can already roughly estimate its two roots (\(1.055\)
and \(8.905\)). Note that is also possible to use the zoom-tool to get
an even better estimates.

Since Newton's method requires the derivative of \(f\), we denote by
\(f'\), we use the \textbf{Autograd} library for its computation. We now
plot our first interactive graphic of the function \(f\) and its
tangent.

    With help of the widget on the right, we can vary the value \(x\) for
which to draw the tangent to \(f(x)\).

    The idea of Newton's method consists in beginning with a reasonable
initial guess for \(x\), say \(x_0\), that is not too distant froom the
root we seek to find. We then approximate the function by its tangent at
the point \(x_0\). With elementary algebra, we then determine the
\(x\)-intercept, say \(x_1\), of the tangent. The value \(x_1\) is then
subsequently used to repeat the process. Now, suppose that we have some
current approximation \(x_n\). We obtain the next better approximation
\(x_{n+1}\) with the following formula

\[x_{n+1} = x_n - \frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)}.\]

Implimented for \(x_0 = -8.5\) and \(6\) steps, we obtain the following
visualization of the algorithm.

    We see that the algorithm converges very rapidely in this example, as it
is already close to the root by step \(3\).

    \subsection{4.2. Least Squares Linear
Regression}\label{least-squares-linear-regression}

    A linear regression consists in the fitting of a reprentative line to a
two-dimentional data set of the form
\((x_1,y_1),(x_2,y_2),\dots, (x_n,y_n), n \in \mathbb{N}\), where
\((x_i,y_i), i=1,\dots,n\) denotes the \(i\)-th data point in the data
set. Expressed mathematically, we seek to find a slope
\(a \in \mathbb{R}\) and an offset \(b \in \mathbb{R}\) such that the
following relationship holds
\[ax_i+b \approx y_i, \text{     for }i=1,\dots,n.\]

Or visually, for a data set consisting of \(n=10\) points:

    \begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
{\color{incolor}In [{\color{incolor}41}]:} \PY{k+kn}{from} \PY{n+nn}{py\PYZus{}code}\PY{n+nn}{.}\PY{n+nn}{least\PYZus{}squares} \PY{k}{import} \PY{n}{hv\PYZus{}points\PYZus{}viz}\PY{p}{,} \PY{n}{least\PYZus{}square\PYZus{}viz}
         \PY{n}{hv\PYZus{}points\PYZus{}viz}
\end{Verbatim}


\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
{\color{outcolor}Out[{\color{outcolor}41}]:} :Overlay
            .Points.I                                  :Points   [x,y]
            .Curve.Sum\_of\_squares\_colon\_7\_full\_stop\_39 :Curve   [x]   (y)
\end{Verbatim}
            
    A common method to find such values \(a\) and \(b\) is the Least Squares
framework. For estimators \(\hat{a}\) and \(\hat{b}\) of respectively
\(a\) and \(b\) we compute the estimated points
\(\hat{y}_i, i \in \mathbb{N}\), by plugging in the estimators in the
above formula. Thus, \[\hat{y}_i = \hat{a}x_i+\hat{b}.\]

If \(\hat{a}\) and \(\hat{b}\), the difference between \(y_i\) and
\(\hat{y}_i\) should be small for each \(i=1, \dots, n\). In fact, we
seek to minimize the sum of the squares of these differences. We then
obtain the following cost function
\[c(\hat{a},\hat{b}):= \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \hat{a}x_i+\hat{b})^2 = \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2\]

The cost function for the previous example can be visualized in the
following way:

\end{Verbatim}
            
    On the left we visualize the data set together with the fitted slope (in
red) and the individual squared errors with respect to the slope
\(\hat{a}\) and the offset \(\hat{b}\). On the right we display the
contour levels corresponding to the cost function. The brighter an area
is, the lower the cost function of its encompassing points is. This can
be verified by watching the \texttt{sum\_of\_squares} value while
changing the values of \(\hat{a}\) and \(\hat{b}\). The combinations of
\(\hat{a}\) and \(\hat{b}\) are also represented by the red point on the
left plot. (Note that due to HoloViews' current restrictions, is was
unfortunately not possible to display the \texttt{sum\_of\_square}
number outside of the plot.)

    \section{5. Matrix Visualization}\label{matrix-visualization}

\subsection{5.1. Colormaps and Standard
Matrices}\label{colormaps-and-standard-matrices}

    In this section, we dicuss a topic that is particularly neglected in the
visualization space: matrix visualization. Common practice to inspect a
matrix seems to be to simply look through it in raw format. This however
is often a frustrating experience as the matrix is usuall too large to
be completly displayed, may contain many digits per entry and is usually
far from being optimally formatted for viewing. While extracting and
rounding sub-matrices may be one option, it can be informative to
visualize the matrix as a 2D-colormap.

For this, we first explore briefly the topic of color mapping, i.e. the
process of translating numerical data into colors. We may for example be
interested to map low values to dark colors and high values to light
colors, as we have previously done Section \ref{repo_activity_viz} and
Section \ref{least_square_viz}. For this, we can use preconsived
palettes of colors - known as colormaps - that incorporate this
characteristic. The following visualization displays four continous
sequential colormaps:

    \begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
{\color{incolor}In [{\color{incolor}20}]:} \PY{k+kn}{from} \PY{n+nn}{py\PYZus{}code}\PY{n+nn}{.}\PY{n+nn}{colormaps} \PY{k}{import} \PY{n}{cmap\PYZus{}seq\PYZus{}viz}\PY{p}{,} \PY{n}{cmap\PYZus{}div\PYZus{}viz}
         \PY{n}{cmap\PYZus{}seq\PYZus{}viz}
\end{Verbatim}


\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
{\color{outcolor}Out[{\color{outcolor}20}]:} :Layout
            .Image.Blues   :Image   [x,y]   (z)
            .Image.Bmw     :Image   [x,y]   (z)
            .Image.Inferno :Image   [x,y]   (z)
            .Image.Viridis :Image   [x,y]   (z)
\end{Verbatim}
            
    In other circumstances, we may be interested in using diverging
colormaps, for example to distinguish between positive and negative
values. Four examples of colormaps with this characterics are the
following:

    \begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
{\color{incolor}In [{\color{incolor}21}]:} \PY{n}{cmap\PYZus{}div\PYZus{}viz}
\end{Verbatim}


\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
{\color{outcolor}Out[{\color{outcolor}21}]:} :Layout
            .Image.Bwr      :Image   [x,y]   (z)
            .Image.PiYG     :Image   [x,y]   (z)
            .Image.RdBu     :Image   [x,y]   (z)
            .Image.Spectral :Image   [x,y]   (z)
\end{Verbatim}
            
    Designing colormaps is surprinsingly difficult. One important aspect is
to ensure that the luminance of the colormap varies smoothly accross the
spectrum to help spot nuances in the data and enable informative black
and white displaying. Another aspect may be to enable accurate
representations for color blind readers. It has been shown that the
tradtionally used \texttt{\textquotesingle{}jet\textquotesingle{}}
colormap is especially ineffective at addressing the mentioned aspects
and has lead to the far more improved colormaps from the
\texttt{\textquotesingle{}Viridis\textquotesingle{}} project. For more
information on this topic, we highly recommend the lecture
\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAoljeRJ3lU}{"A Better Default
Colormap for Matplotlib"} by Nathaniel Smith.

    We now use the above colormaps to visualize some standard matrices: to
begin with, an identity matrix, a band block matrix and a triangular
matrix. All matrices are of dimension \(n\) x \(n\) with \(n=25\) and
the two used colormaps are
\texttt{\textquotesingle{}blues\textquotesingle{}} and
\texttt{\textquotesingle{}RdBu\textquotesingle{}}.

{\color{incolor}In [{\color{incolor}1}]:} \PY{k+kn}{from} \PY{n+nn}{py\PYZus{}code}\PY{n+nn}{.}\PY{n+nn}{standard\PYZus{}matrices}\PY{n+nn}{.}\PY{n+nn}{py} \PY{k}{import} \PY{n}{standard\PYZus{}matrices\PYZus{}viz}\PY{p}{,} \PY{n}{corr\PYZus{}and\PYZus{}missing\PYZus{}viz}\PY{p}{,} \PY{n}{matrix\PYZus{}corr\PYZus{}big\PYZus{}viz}
        \PY{n}{standard\PYZus{}matrices\PYZus{}viz}
\end{Verbatim}


    
    
    
    
    
    
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
{\color{outcolor}Out[{\color{outcolor}1}]:} :Layout

           .Image.III :Image   [x,y]   (z)
\end{Verbatim}
            
    Note that we have again activated the hover-tool to enable looking at
individual values in the matrices.

Next, we generate two correlation matrices, one with strong dependence
structure (left) and one with weak dependence structre (right). The
third matrix represents a random matrix with \(100\) missing values
(green color). Here we set \(n=40\) and use the colormaps
\texttt{\textquotesingle{}bwr\textquotesingle{}} and again
\texttt{\textquotesingle{}blues\textquotesingle{}}.

    \begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
{\color{incolor}In [{\color{incolor}3}]:} \PY{n}{corr\PYZus{}and\PYZus{}missing\PYZus{}viz}

           .Image.III :Image   [x,y]   (z)
\end{Verbatim}
            
    The correlation structure becomes immediately apparent upon
visualization, as do the missing values. Checking a matrix for missing
values can be particularly useful, as these break many standard
functions.

Matrix visualization can also help us with larger data sets. We now
generate a correlation matrix with strong dependence structure for
\(n=500\).

{\color{outcolor}Out[{\color{outcolor}4}]:} :Image   [x,y]   (z)
\end{Verbatim}
            
    Although each entry is now almost too small to be seen, the
visualization can still help to get a broad overview and the zoom tool
encourages to explore sub-matrices.

    \subsection{5.2. Recognizing Symmetric
Matrices}\label{recognizing-symmetric-matrices}

    Next we study how a matrix visualization could help us determine if a
matrix is symmetric or close to symmetric. Let us first visualize one
such matrix with \(n=40\).

    \begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
{\color{incolor}In [{\color{incolor}1}]:} \PY{k+kn}{from} \PY{n+nn}{py\PYZus{}code}\PY{n+nn}{.}\PY{n+nn}{symmetric\PYZus{}matrices} \PY{k}{import} \PY{n}{matrix\PYZus{}sym\PYZus{}viz}\PY{p}{,} \PY{n}{matrix\PYZus{}sym\PYZus{}examples\PYZus{}viz}\PY{p}{,} \PY{n}{diff\PYZus{}viz}\PY{p}{,} \PY{n}{diff\PYZus{}new\PYZus{}cmap\PYZus{}viz}\PY{p}{,} \PY{n}{ratio\PYZus{}viz}\PY{p}{,} \PY{n}{ratio\PYZus{}new\PYZus{}cmap\PYZus{}viz}
        \PY{n}{matrix\PYZus{}sym\PYZus{}viz}
\end{Verbatim}


    
    
    
    
    
    
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
{\color{outcolor}Out[{\color{outcolor}1}]:} :Image   [x,y]   (z)
\end{Verbatim}
            
    We are able to dissern the symmetry, but if we were not told about it,
we would probably not have recognized it straight away. May there be
better ways to visualize this property? In real world applications, the
symmetry is sometimes not one to one. Maybe there are just a few values
that differ to achieve perfect symmetry? Maybe there is some noise added
to the symmetry? If so, do we measure this noise on an absolute basis or
relative basis? Answering these questions possibly require different
visualizations. To demonstrate this, we create three examples by
modidifying the above symmetric matrix. For the first example, we add
independent random normal variables (mean \(0\) and variance \(0.15\))
to \(100\) values randomly selected, in the second and third example we
add respectively independent normal random variables to all entries with
mean \(0\) and variance \(0.02\) and \(0.12\) respectively. The three
matrices are the following.

    \begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
{\color{incolor}In [{\color{incolor}2}]:} \PY{n}{matrix\PYZus{}sym\PYZus{}examples\PYZus{}viz}
\end{Verbatim}


\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
{\color{outcolor}Out[{\color{outcolor}2}]:} :Layout
           .Image.I   :Image   [x,y]   (z)
           .Image.II  :Image   [x,y]   (z)
           .Image.III :Image   [x,y]   (z)
\end{Verbatim}
            
    As discussed previously, it is difficult to deduce much from the
visualization of these three matrices. We begin by visualizing the
respective absolute differences between the lower and upper triangular
matrices and plot these.

    \begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
{\color{incolor}In [{\color{incolor}3}]:} \PY{n}{diff\PYZus{}sym\PYZus{}examples\PYZus{}viz}
\end{Verbatim}


\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
{\color{outcolor}Out[{\color{outcolor}3}]:} :Layout
           .Image.I   :Image   [x,y]   (z)
           .Image.II  :Image   [x,y]   (z)
           .Image.III :Image   [x,y]   (z)
\end{Verbatim}
            
    We now see with more clarity, what the differences between the two
triangular matrices are. While the colorbars on the right indicate the
ranges of the colormaps, from a pure visualization perspective, it may
make more sense to adapt the colors ranges to the value ranges of the
original matrices, ex-diagionals (as they do not play a role in
determining symmetry). Thus we may adjust our plots in the following
way.

    \begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
{\color{incolor}In [{\color{incolor}4}]:} \PY{n}{diff\PYZus{}relative\PYZus{}sym\PYZus{}examples\PYZus{}viz}
\end{Verbatim}


\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
{\color{outcolor}Out[{\color{outcolor}4}]:} :Layout
           .Image.I   :Image   [x,y]   (z)
           .Image.II  :Image   [x,y]   (z)
           .Image.III :Image   [x,y]   (z)
\end{Verbatim}
            
    This way, we see the relative difference between the low random noise
and heigh random noise examples more accurately. If absolute differences
are the measure with which we would define near symmetry, then from the
visulazations we would estimate that Example 1 and Example 3 do not meet
the criteria, while Example 2 does.

In the next plot we visualize the ratio between the lower triangular
matrix and the upper triangular matrix for each example. The number 1
has been subtracted so that the a value of zero (white color) represents
no change.

    \begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
{\color{incolor}In [{\color{incolor}2}]:} \PY{n}{ratio\PYZus{}viz}
\end{Verbatim}


\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]

           .Image.III :Image   [x,y]   (z)
\end{Verbatim}
            
    Some ratios are dramatically high. This is due to some values in the
upper triangular matrix being near zero and thus leading to very large
ratios when dividing by them. This method is thus not ideal in our case
study. Nevertheless, we visualize this ratio another time by changing
the range of the colormaps and thus clipping some of the very large
values (i.e. their color is at the minimum or maximum of the colormap,
although it corresponding value is respectively lower or higher that
this minimum or maximum.)

    The same issue of near zero values lead also in this visualization to
large ratios for many matrix entries. Thus we discard this approach to
determine symmetrie for these examples.

    \subsection{5.3. Gauss Elimination - LU
Decomposition}\label{gauss-elimination---lu-decomposition}

    Gauss elimination is the most important algorithm to solve a system of
linear equations, say \(Ax=y\) with \(A\) a \(n\) x \(n\) real matrix,
\(n \in \mathbb{N}\), \(x,y \in \mathbb{R}^n\). The idea is to transform
the system of equations into an equivalent one in the form of a lower
(\(L\)) and an upper triangular matrix (\(U\)), since if \(L\) is a
triangular matrix, the system \(Lx = y\) can easily be solved by forward
or backward substitution. I.e. if \(A = LU\), then
\(Ax=b \Longleftrightarrow L(Ux)=y \Longleftrightarrow Lz=y \text{ and } Ux=z\).

We seek to visualize the Gauss elimination aglorithm without pivot. For
this, we define the vector
\(l^{(k)} = (0,\dots,t_{k+1},\dots, t_n)^T \in \mathbb{R}^n\) for
\(k \in \{1, \dots, n\}\) and the unit vector
\(e_k = (0, \dots, 0, 1, 0, \dots, 0)^T \in \mathbb{R}^n\). With this,
we define the Gauss-Matrix \(M_k\) in the following way

\[M_k := I_n-l^{(k)}e_k^T,\]

where \(I_n\) is the \(n\) x \(n\) identity matrix.

The characteristic of the Gauss-Matrix is best seen when left-multiplyed
to the vector \(x:= (x_1, \dots, x_n)\):

\[M_kx = (x_1, \dots, x_k, 0, \dots, 0)^T.\]

Thus, with the help of these matrices, we can achieve the seek
decomposition with the following algorithm:

\textbf{Gauss eliminiation algorithm without pivot}

1. Initialization: \(A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}\)

2. \(A^{(1)}:=A;\)

3. \textbf{for} \(k=1,\dots,n-1\)
\textbf{do}\(l^{(k)}:= \Bigg(0, \dots, 0, \frac{a_{k+1,k}^{(k)}}{a_{k,k}^{(k)}}, \dots, \frac{a_{n,k}^{(k)}}{a_{k,k}^{(k)}} \Bigg)\)
with \(k\) times \(0\) for the first entries;
\(M_k := I_n-l^{(k)}e_k^T;\) \(A^{(k+1)}:= M_kA^{(k)}\)\textbf{end}

With the following results: \(U:= A^{(n)}\) is the upper right
triangular matrix, \(L:= M_1^{-1} \dots M_{n-1}^{-1}\) is the lower left
triangular matrix and we have \(A=LU\).

We now apply the algorithm to a regular matrix
\(A \in \mathbb{R}^{15\times15}\).

    \subsection{5.4 Multidimentional Plotting with Color
Channels}\label{multidimentional-plotting-with-color-channels}

    In this last section, we study the possibility to plot multidimentional
images by superposing these using different color channels. For example,
we may be interested in visualizing the real part and the imaginary part
of a complex matrix. For this, we could color the real part in red and
the imaginary part in blue. The library \texttt{scipy} allows to
generate specific matrices, among others a complex discrete Fourier
transform matrix. We use this matrix to illustrate our example.

    The real and imaginary part of the complex matrix look rather similar,
in particular outside of the center. However, the superposition shows
that there are clearly differences and while most parts of both matrices
do overlap, they do not coinside. For the comparaison, the blended
version is very useful.
